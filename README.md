# HTML-AND-CSS-PROJECTS

Projects completed during my HTML and CSS coursework.





This repository contains the projects and exercises I completed while working through my HTML and CSS coursework at The Tech Academy. It reflects my learning process as I built a foundation in front-end web development, including structuring webpages with HTML, styling them with CSS, and creating clean, responsive layouts.



All of the work here was developed locally and pushed using GitHub Desktop, giving me hands-on experience with version control while also serving as a growing portfolio of my progress and skills.
