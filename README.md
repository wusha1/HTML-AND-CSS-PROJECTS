# HTML and CSS Projects

This repository contains projects and exercises completed during my HTML and CSS coursework at The Tech Academy.

The purpose of this repository is to store, organize, and track my progress as I learn the fundamentals of front-end web development. It includes hands-on practice with HTML structure, CSS styling, layouts, and responsive design concepts.

All projects are regularly pushed from a local repository using GitHub Desktop, allowing me to gain experience with version control and maintain an online portfolio of my work.
